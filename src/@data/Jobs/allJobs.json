Create a visually striking and\nmemorable gaming logo for the brand &quot;Abstract EYE.&quot; The logo should embody the essence of\nabstraction while incorporating an eye-related motif to reflect the brand's identity. The logo will\nbe used across various gaming platforms, social media profiles, merchandise, and potentially\nas an in-game emblem.\n\nDownload the Sample Logo PDF:    https://cutt.ly/cwgxV55Y\n\n## Requirements:\n\n1) Theme: The logo design should fuse abstract elements with an eye-related theme,\nsymbolizing the brand name &quot;Abstract EYE.&quot;\n2) Eye Motif: Incorporate an eye for an eye-inspired element within the design. This could be a\nstylized eye, an abstract representation of an eye, or an innovative twist on traditional eye\nimagery.\n3) Simplicity: While the logo can have complex elements, ensure that the overall design\nremains clear and easily recognizable, even when scaled down to smaller sizes.\n4) Font: Choose a font for the brand name &quot;Abstract EYE&quot; that complements the abstract and\ngaming feel of the logo.\n5) Uniqueness: The logo should stand out and be distinct from other gaming logos. Avoid using\nclichéd gaming symbols.\n## Color Palette:\n\nRed: Symbolizing passion, energy, and intensity.\nWhite: Representing clarity, simplicity, and neutrality.\nYellow: Conveying positivity, brightness, and excitement.\n## Deliverables:\n\nMain Logo: A full-color version of the logo design with all the required elements. (EPS file, PNG\nfile, JPG file, SVG file and PDF file)\nTransparent Background: A version of the logo with a transparent background to ensure\nversatility across different applications.\n## Budget:\n\nThe budget for this project is 100$.\n## Submission:\n\nInterested designers are requested to submit their portfolio, along with a brief proposal\noutlining their creative approach to the project, anticipated timeline, and cost estimate. The\nselected designer will collaborate closely with the client to bring the vision of &quot;Abstract EYE&quot; to\nlife through an exceptional gaming logo.","category2":null,"subcategory2":null,"duration":"1 to 3 months","shortDuration":"1-3 months","durationLabel":"1 to 3 months","engagement":null,"shortEngagement":null,"amount":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":100},"recno":1007426085,"uid":"1691164835342786560","client":{"paymentVerificationStatus":null,"location":{"country":null},"totalSpent":null,"totalReviews":0,"totalFeedback":0,"companyRid":0,"companyName":null,"edcUserId":0,"lastContractPlatform":null,"lastContractRid":0,"lastContractTitle":null,"feedbackText":"No feedback yet","companyOrgUid":null,"hasFinancialPrivacy":false},"freelancersToHire":1,"relevanceEncoded":"{}","enterpriseJob":false,"tierText":"Entry level","tier":"Entry level","tierLabel":"Experience Level","isSaved":null,"feedback":null,"proposalsTier":"Less than 5","isApplied":false,"sticky":false,"stickyLabel":"","jobTs":"1692040092000","prefFreelancerLocationMandatory":false,"prefFreelancerLocation":[],"premium":false,"plusBadge":null,"publishedOn":"2023-08-14T19:08:12+00:00","renewedOn":null,"sandsService":null,"sandsSpec":null,"sandsAttrs":null,"occupation":null,"attrs":[{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626755029843968","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Logo Design"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1052162208864981006","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Adobe Illustrator"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1052162208852398098","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Adobe Photoshop"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626742929276928","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Graphic Design"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626747312324608","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Illustration"}],"isLocal":false,"workType":null,"locations":[],"occupations":{"category":{"uid":"531770282580668421","prefLabel":"Design & Creative"},"subcategories":[{"uid":"531770282593251334","prefLabel":"Graphic, Editorial & Presentation Design"}],"oservice":{"uid":"1017484851352698959","prefLabel":"Graphic Design"}},"weeklyBudget":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":0},"hourlyBudgetText":null,"hourlyBudget":{"type":null,"min":0,"max":0},"tags":[],"clientRelation":{"companyRid":0,"companyName":null,"edcUserId":0,"lastContractPlatform":null,"lastContractRid":0,"lastContractTitle":null},"totalFreelancersToHire":null,"teamUid":null,"multipleFreelancersToHirePredicted":null,"connectPrice":null},{"title":"YouTube Automation:.Looking to have a channel get all videos made and monetized.","createdOn":"2023-08-14T19:07:31+00:00","type":1,"ciphertext":"~01473b862e85a2f286","description":"I have multiple new faceless YouTube channels you will be working with.

I think with the right skill set, this will be a quick fix. I've been asked to create a Governance Calendar in excel. The calendar will track our marketing campaigns / email blasts. Most of the emails are recurring on a weekly basis. We do have some ad-hoc emails that are single sends. \n\nPurpose: The goal of this calendar is to see if there is any overlap when an ad-hoc campaign comes up. We have communication limits set up so that we do not want to send too many emails on the same day. The &quot;Nurture&quot; or &quot;Drip&quot; campaigns are sent out at the same date/time on a weekly basis.\n\nI found a calendar template on an Excel Forum, which gives a good starting point. See attached. \n\nThe problem is the recurring functionality is not working. We need it to automatically add to the calendar from the Start Date and whether it recurs weekly or not.

This may seem like a very simple task, however I’m really looking for high quality and engaging editing skills and editors which will really make an effort with nice and smooth animations throughout the video. \n\nThis is a great example of how I will want the videos to be edited, including footage, quick 2d animations, text, graphics. Please check this out : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02o-gxQy130\n\nEach video will range from 6-15 mins long\n\nIf interested, please reach out to me and send a very quick example of how you would edit such video using the techniques and style as written above\n\nIf your editing skills match what I’m looking for, I will definitely want to make this a long term partnership with weekly work available.\n\nThank you,\n\nCyprian\n","category2":null,"subcategory2":null,"duration":"Less than 1 month","shortDuration":"1 month","durationLabel":"Less than 1 month","engagement":null,"shortEngagement":null,"amount":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":55},"recno":1007425862,"uid":"1691162310026854400","client":{"paymentVerificationStatus":null,"location":{"country":null},"totalSpent":null,"totalReviews":0,"totalFeedback":0,"companyRid":0,"companyName":null,"edcUserId":0,"lastContractPlatform":null,"lastContractRid":0,"lastContractTitle":null,"feedbackText":"No feedback yet","companyOrgUid":null,"hasFinancialPrivacy":false},"freelancersToHire":1,"relevanceEncoded":"{}","enterpriseJob":false,"tierText":"Intermediate","tier":"Intermediate","tierLabel":"Experience Level","isSaved":null,"feedback":null,"proposalsTier":"Less than 5","isApplied":false,"sticky":false,"stickyLabel":"","jobTs":"1692039492000","prefFreelancerLocationMandatory":false,"prefFreelancerLocation":[],"premium":false,"plusBadge":null,"publishedOn":"2023-08-14T18:58:12+00:00","renewedOn":null,"sandsService":null,"sandsSpec":null,"sandsAttrs":null,"occupation":null,"attrs":[{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626793223176192","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Video Editing"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626793273507840","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Video Post-Editing"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1052162208990810114","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Explainer Video"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626797799161856","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"YouTube Development"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626797811744768","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"YouTube Marketing"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626735228534784","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"English"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1052162208990810123","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Adobe Premiere Pro"}],"isLocal":false,"workType":null,"locations":[],"occupations":{"category":{"uid":"531770282580668421","prefLabel":"Design & Creative"},"subcategories":[{"uid":"1356688570056970240","prefLabel":"Video & Animation"}],"oservice":{"uid":"1044578476142100540","prefLabel":"Video Editing"}},"weeklyBudget":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":0},"hourlyBudgetText":null,"hourlyBudget":{"type":null,"min":0,"max":0},"tags":[],"clientRelation":{"companyRid":0,"companyName":null,"edcUserId":0,"lastContractPlatform":null,"lastContractRid":0,"lastContractTitle":null},"totalFreelancersToHire":null,"teamUid":null,"multipleFreelancersToHirePredicted":null,"connectPrice":null},{"title":"Designer required on a monthly basis","createdOn":"2023-08-14T18:58:01+00:00","type":1,"ciphertext":"~01226283c76ba57b3e","description":"Monthly rate: 200$\nRequired designer to create designs for social media channels (photo posts + animated posts). \nWe are an agency and have accounts in different industries (food and beverage -

I am looking for an expert that can ENSURE me they know exactly what the below entails so that I don't have to lead what the solution will be. Expert English is a must as this is very technical and I can't have any issues with language translation barriers. \n\nI want someone who can implement this now and fast with little oversight. And someone who will lead the dashboard piece.\n\nGoogle needs/issues\n- [ ] Everything related to google should be named HN (right now I feel like a lot of my work stuff with Google is setup under my personal email kxxxxFxxxxx@gmail.com and not hi@hexxxnxxxxn.com and therefore once you start getting into specific google products such as their analytics and ad platforms, they aren’t using the HN accounts. Here’s the thing though - if once you decode this you realize that everything that is under kxxxxFxxxxx@gmail.com is where stuff is already running and setup, and nothing is running/setup under HN then let’s just go ahead and delete all the HN platforms. The main confusion comes in where I feel like I have 2 accounts and all the ones named with my company names don’t have anything underneath them so I constantly click into them and see nothing. \n- [ ] When I go to Google Ads, there are two accounts. I just need one. One has an ad running, the other doesn’t. I just need the one with the ad. This is the gist of the problem above, I just know for sure that google ads has 2. \n    - [ ] Ensure the one with the ad is the one connected to my GA4 account. \n- [ ] GA4- I believe there are also two google analytics accounts and/or maybe when you’re logged in you can see 2 diff homes for analytics. (Again, same as first issue, I just know the analytics account is confusing). Not sure what the word “home” should be to explain what I mean. Point is, it’s confusing. I just want one login, with one “home” that is there to know where to go to get all our analytics and what’s connected to our website, and ad account. \n- [ ] Setup all tracking and create a dashboard. I have the basic but know that more can be setup. I don’t know how this is done exactly so want you to show me what you need from me first (like the blueprint of what’s possible and what most Ecommerce sites do) so that I can say yes/no before creating the tracking codes. I want to ensure what’s created will be relevant to my brand and the dashboard has the data I’m interested in displayed. \n- [ ] FB - Meta ads manager ALWAYS has the module there encouraging us to setup the Google conversion API, and I know I did that. So my assumption is that it’s setup incorrectly. Please dig into this and fix whatever is needed.\n- [ ] I have 2 google locations. I need just 1. I believe this is related to the whole two google “homes” issue that is causing so much confusion. I got the validation card in the mail and submitted it. And I feel like one account (the Mpls location) SHOULD be setup correctly now. But there’s still a St Paul address showing up and it’s never clear where you should log in and what people are seeing when they actually Google us. I know for a fact that the St Paul location comes up for some people and is a bad experience. \n    - [ ] Related to this - there are some reviews on one account. It should be on our Mpls location. I just want to make sure those are kept and that all the hours/photos I uploaded to the one profile is maintained in an ideal world. If you get into it and say that all the data is under the wrong account then let me know before deleting an account or bringing all data over to the other one. \n- [ ] ADS - I want someone to walk me through the different types of Google ads. I have an ad running right now. It is just for a 25 mile radius of my store and only runs on the days we’re open. But I know there are specific google shopping ads (Performance Max I believe they call them?) I want to start ramping up my google ands so want someone who can give me a tutorial. \n- [ ] SEO review - I want someone to ensure my website is setup from a technical standpoint to ensure that Google is happy and I’m optimized for SEO. I have an SEO person who is going out and creating backlinks, and we’re handling blog posts. We can do meta descriptions, too. That’s not what I’m talking about. This is the more technical piece of Google and SEO and ensuring we are doing everything correctly. \n\n\nMeta\n    - [ ] FB/Meta - pixel is counting at roughly 2.7 times what is actually happening. So need to go into our analytics on our site and see where the tracking codes have been placed on various pages on my website to ensure they aren’t duplicated. After you check that, if you find that this isn’t the problem… Then tell me why duplicated tracking is happening and please fix it. \n    - [ ] Ads - I run Meta ads and DON’T need any help there.

For each article, I will ask for 2 screenshots of the account member area with your confidential information removed (cut out or blanked out).\n\nArticles should be original and informative, providing a lot of value to readers. AI-generated articles will generate a complaint to Upwork. Re-write of existing articles from the internet will not be accepted.

They need to know whether you're focusing on match analysis, player profiles, historical moments, tactical breakdowns, or any other football-related content.\nResearching Football Topics: To provide accurate and up-to-date content, the scriptwriter conducts thorough research on the chosen football topics. This includes gathering statistics, historical data, current news, player profiles, team dynamics, and other relevant information.\nCreating Engaging Concepts: Collaborating with you, the scriptwriter generates engaging and creative concepts for your videos. These concepts serve as the foundation for the script and determine the angle, focus, and overall theme of each video.\nStructuring the Script: The scriptwriter creates a clear and organized script structure. This includes dividing the content into sections, such as introduction, key points, analysis, visual aids, and conclusion. The script's structure ensures a logical flow and engaging narrative.\nCrafting Compelling Introductions: The scriptwriter writes captivating introductions that grab viewers' attention from the start. This could involve sharing intriguing facts, posing questions, or setting the scene for the football topic being discussed.\nIncorporating Analysis: If your channel focuses on match analysis or tactical breakdowns, the scriptwriter delves into the technical aspects of football. They break down plays, strategies, player movements, and other elements to provide insightful and informative analysis.\nIncluding Visual References: Scriptwriters suggest visual elements such as video clips, images, graphics, and animations that can enhance the video's quality and viewer understanding. These visuals complement the script's content and provide a comprehensive viewing experience.\nWriting for Automation: Since your channel is automated, the scriptwriter needs to write the script in a way that is suitable for text-to-speech conversion or other automated narration methods. This involves using clear punctuation, timing cues, and format instructions to ensure a natural delivery.\nMaintaining Consistency: The scriptwriter ensures consistency in tone, style, and branding across all videos. This consistency helps establish your channel's identity and makes it easier for viewers to recognize your content.\nHighlighting Key Moments: If your channel covers specific football highlights or memorable moments, the scriptwriter identifies and highlights these key moments in the script. They describe the action, context, and significance to enhance viewer engagement.\nCrafting Calls to Action: At the end of each video, the scriptwriter includes a compelling call to action (CTA). This encourages viewers to engage with your content, such as liking, subscribing, commenting, and sharing.\nFact-Checking and Accuracy: The scriptwriter ensures the accuracy of all information presented in the script. Incorrect data or outdated facts can undermine the credibility of your channel.\nAdapting to Feedback: Collaboration is key. The scriptwriter works closely with you to review and refine the script based on your feedback. This iterative process helps create scripts that align with your vision and preferences.\nSEO Optimization: Depending on your strategy, the scriptwriter may incorporate relevant football-related keywords and phrases for better SEO, helping your videos reach a wider audience.\nOverall, the scriptwriter's role is to create scripts that effectively convey football-related content, maintain viewer engagement, and provide valuable insights, all while adhering to the specific requirements of your automated YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n\n","category2":null,"subcategory2":null,"duration":"1 to 3 months","shortDuration":"1-3 months","durationLabel":"1 to 3 months","engagement":"Less than 30 hrs/week","shortEngagement":"Less than 30","amount":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":0},"recno":1007423131,"uid":"1691133232175493120","client":{"paymentVerificationStatus":null,"location":{"country":null},"totalSpent":null,"totalReviews":0,"totalFeedback":0,"companyRid":0,"companyName":null,"edcUserId":0,"lastContractPlatform":null,"lastContractRid":0,"lastContractTitle":null,"feedbackText":"No feedback yet","companyOrgUid":null,"hasFinancialPrivacy":false},"freelancersToHire":1,"relevanceEncoded":"{}","enterpriseJob":false,"tierText":"Intermediate","tier":"Intermediate","tierLabel":"Experience Level","isSaved":null,"feedback":null,"proposalsTier":"Less than 5","isApplied":false,"sticky":false,"stickyLabel":"","jobTs":"1692032756000","prefFreelancerLocationMandatory":false,"prefFreelancerLocation":[],"premium":false,"plusBadge":null,"publishedOn":"2023-08-14T17:05:56+00:00","renewedOn":null,"sandsService":null,"sandsSpec":null,"sandsAttrs":null,"occupation":null,"attrs":[{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1356688438221606912","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Film Screenplay"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1052162208990810114","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Explainer Video"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"996364628000108559","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Adventure"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"996364628000108558","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Action"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626735228534784","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"English"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626728416985088","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Creative Writing"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1031626778232733696","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Scripting"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1484275056567308288","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Sports Journalism"},{"parentSkillUid":null,"freeText":null,"skillType":3,"uid":"1691099106002874369","highlighted":false,"prettyName":"Football"}],"isLocal":false,"workType":null,"locations":[],"occupations":{"category":{"uid":"531770282580668423","prefLabel":"Writing"},"subcategories":[{"uid":"1301900640421842944","prefLabel":"Content Writing"}],"oservice":{"uid":"1044578476142100528","prefLabel":"Scriptwriting"}},"weeklyBudget":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":0},"hourlyBudgetText":"$13.00-$50.00","hourlyBudget":{"type":"MANUAL","min":13,"max":50},"tags":[],"clientRelation":{"companyRid":0,"companyName":null,"edcUserId":0,"lastContractPlatform":null,"lastContractRid":0,"lastContractTitle":null},"totalFreelancersToHire":null,"teamUid":null,"multipleFreelancersToHirePredicted":null,"connectPrice":null},{"title":"Creative Marketing Writer  ","createdOn":"2023-08-14T16:58:05+00:00","type":1,"ciphertext":"~01cfcf3c350ac62074","description":"Looking for a strong marketing content writer to complete a small project for us.
